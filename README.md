# Stock_Analysis_And_Recommendation
Final Project Submission for 201612-67    

The dataset we choose is from Quandl, Wiki EOD Stock Prices   
https://www.quandl.com/data/WIKI-Wiki-EOD-Stock-Prices/documentation/documentation?modal=null    

We achieved the function of predicting short-term and long-term trends of each stock, which is realized by analyzing the trend of moving average.    

Besides, we completed stock recommendation by doing K-means Clustering of stocks.    

We also completed a linear regression model for DJIA for stock market prediction.
